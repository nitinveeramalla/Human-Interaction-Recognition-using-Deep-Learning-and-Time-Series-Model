Pre-Requsites(Support Software):
GPU that supports CUDA Tool Kit

Hardware requirements
The following GPU-enabled devices are supported:

NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® Compute Capability 3.5 or higher. See the list of CUDA-enabled GPU cards.
Software requirements
The following NVIDIA® software must be installed on your system:

NVIDIA® GPU drivers —CUDA 10.1 requires 418.x or higher.
CUDA® Toolkit —TensorFlow supports CUDA 10.1 (TensorFlow >= 2.1.0)
CUPTI ships with the CUDA Toolkit.
cuDNN SDK (>= 7.6)
(Optional) TensorRT 6.0 to improve latency and throughput for inference on some models.


Installation Steps after install support software:::

Step 1  : Install Anaconda

Step 2  :Open conda cmd as admin

Step 3  :use conda env create -v -f tensorflow.yml
	:to create a virtual environment
	:Copy tensrflow-gpu.yml file in the cmd directory(generally at c:\Windows\Users\Username\)

Step 4  : Install python ipykernel 3.7
	python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name "Python 3.7(tensorflow)"

Step 5: close terminal and open the project directory and on the URL type cmd and press enter

Step 6 : Activate the environment using:
         conda activate tensorflow  

Step 7: Run Jupyter notebokk using the command Jupyter Note Book

Step 8: Run the .ipynb file from the project directory


NOTE: Before Running the Code Make sure to properly change the Path of the project folders in your directory
